Many types of application need to be able to perform an action at regular
intervals. The obvious example is a clock application, but other examples
might be

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
A file viewer, which watches at regular intervals to see if the file being
displayed has changed, and shows the new contents if it has.

<LI>
<P>
A monitor application (like the WIndows NT performance monitor) which
displays updated information every second.

<LI>
<P>
A network ``ping'' utility, which polls a remote server at regular
intervals, to see that it is still running.

</UL>
<P>
Adding a timer to your application is easy. All you do is call the
<CODE>AddTimer()</CODE> method on the window you want to ``own'' the timer.
When the timer expires, its
<CODE>Timer</CODE> event is fired, which you can catch in the normal way.

<P>
For example,

<P>
<PRE>    $t1 = $main-&gt;AddTimer('T1', 1000);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    sub T1_Timer {
        print &quot;Timer went off!\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
Some things to note:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
The <CODE>AddTimer()</CODE> method takes two explicit parameters, the timer
name and the interval (in milliseconds). The normal <CODE>option =&amp;gt; value</CODE> syntax is <STRONG>not</STRONG>
used.

<LI>
<P>
The timer keeps firing repeatedly. To disable a timer, use
$timer-&gt;Kill().

<LI>
<P>
To reset the interval of a timer, use $timer-&gt;Interval(n). Setting an
interval of zero disables the timer.

</UL>
<P>
That's about all there is to timers.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Status_Bars">Status Bars</A></H2>
<P>
To add a status bar to your window, just use

<P>
<PRE>    $sb = $main-&gt;AddStatusBar();
</PRE>
<P>
The normal options are available, but in general you don't need them.

<P>
The only surprise is that your status bar will <STRONG>not</STRONG> resize automatically when your main window resizes. You need to include
code in your main window resize event handler to resize the status bar. The
following code will do the job:

<P>
<PRE>    sub Main_Resize {
        $sb-&gt;Move(0, $main-&gt;ScaleHeight - $sb-&gt;Height);
        $sb-&gt;Resize($main-&gt;ScaleWidth, $sb-&gt;Height);
    }
</PRE>
<P>
You can write text to your status bar using the <CODE>Text()</CODE> method.

<P>
<PRE>    $sb-&gt;Text(&quot;This appears in the status bar&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
To clear the status bar, just write an empty string.

<P>
Many utility programs these days add an icon to the Windows ``System Tray''
- the small area on the taskbar near the clock. Once again, this is easy
with Win32::GUI - you simply use the <CODE>AddNotifyIcon()</CODE> method. A
notify icon has four key properties - a name (which is used for event
handling, just like for any other Win32::GUI object), an ID (which is just
a unique number, used internally, you specify it and then ignore it), a
tooltip (a string which is displayed when you hold the mouse pointer over
the icon) and an icon (a Win32::GUI::Icon object - you create this using
the <CODE>new()</CODE> constructor, passing the name of the .ico file to
use). Notify icons have Click and RightClick events, to let you process
mouse clicks.

<P>
The normal protocol for an application which uses a notify icon is for the
main window to start hidden, and to show the window when the icon is
clicked. When the main window is minimised, it hides itself, leaving just
the notify icon visible.

<P>
The simplest way to demonstrate this is to show some working code...

<P>
<PRE>    use Win32::GUI;
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    $main = Win32::GUI::Window-&gt;new(-name =&gt; 'Main', -text =&gt; 'Perl',
                                    -width =&gt; 200, -height =&gt; 200);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    $icon = new Win32::GUI::Icon('GUIPERL.ICO');
    $ni = $main-&gt;AddNotifyIcon(-name =&gt; &quot;NI&quot;, -id =&gt; 1,
                               -icon =&gt; $icon, -tip =&gt; &quot;Hello&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Win32::GUI::Dialog();
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    sub Main_Terminate {
        -1;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    sub Main_Minimize {
        $main-&gt;Disable();
        $main-&gt;Hide();
        1;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    sub NI_Click {
        $main-&gt;Enable();
        $main-&gt;Show();
        1;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
Some points to note

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
To remove the window's icon from the taskbar, it is necessary to diable the
window as well as hiding it. And hence, when we show the window again, we
need to re-enable it.

<LI>
<P>
There is a small bug in this program. The tray icon does not disappear
immediately when the program terminates. Instead, it remains in the system
tray until you point the mouse cursor at it, when it disappears. This is a
bug in Win32::GUI - when you close your program, you should explicitly
remove any system tray icons you still have displayed. Win32::GUI does not
(yet) have a way of removing a tray icon. Hopefully, this will be fixed in
a later version.

</UL>
<P>
That's it for the simpler objects available in the Win32::GUI package. Even
though I have referred to them as simple, it is possible to create some
fairly complicated applications using just what we have seen so far.

<P>
In the next couple of tutorials, I will move on to the more sophisticated
controls available - list views and tree views.
