In part 1 of this tutorial, we covered the basics of Win32::GUI
programming, using a simple label control to display information. But
real-world applications don't just display information as labels. We need
to be able to obtain information from the user, respond to mouse clicks,
etc etc.

<P>
Some of the basic Windows controls supported by Win32::GUI include

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Buttons, for taking actions.

<LI>
<P>
Edit boxes, for data entry.

<LI>
<P>
Checkboxes, for selecting options from a list.

<LI>
<P>
Radio buttons, for choosing from mutually exclusive options.

<LI>
<P>
Combo boxes and list boxes, for selection from lists.

<LI>
<P>
And many other more complex controls, such as list views, tree views,
status bars, tab strips, etc.

</UL>
<P>
We have already covered nearly all of the programming techniques for using
these controls in our discussion of the label control in part 1. The
following section summarises the basic controls available, and any
important issues regarding their use. Armed with this and the main
Win32::GUI documentation, it should be possible to develop reasonably
complex applications.

<P>
For this part of the tutorial, we will use a very basic ``framework''
application, to which we can add functionality. We won't worry about issues
like positioning, layout, resizing, etc, as these will only distract from
the main point, which is the control handling.

<P>
So, our basic application is

<P>
<PRE>    use Win32::GUI;
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    $main = Win32::GUI::Window-&gt;new(-name =&gt; 'Main', -text =&gt; 'Perl',
                                    -width =&gt; 200, -height =&gt; 200);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    $main-&gt;Show();
    Win32::GUI::Dialog();
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    sub Main_Terminate {
        -1;
    }
</PRE>
<P>
Now, the basic approach to adding any control to a window is the same. We
saw it before, when we added a label. We simply use the window's
<CODE>AddXXX()</CODE> method, where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the control type we want to add. So, we have, <CODE>AddButton(),</CODE>
<CODE>AddTextfield(),</CODE> <CODE>AddCheckbox(),</CODE>
<CODE>AddCombobox(),</CODE> <CODE>AddListbox(),</CODE>
<CODE>AddRadioButton(),</CODE> etc.

<P>
All of these methods work the same way, in that they take a series of
options, which define the appearance and behaviour of the control. Many of
the options are common to all Win32::GUI controls (such as <CODE>-width</CODE> and <CODE>-height</CODE>) but a few are control-specific.

<P>
The controls themselves support events, much like the main window with its
<CODE>Terminate</CODE> event. Events are control-specific, but tend to be fairly general (many
controls have a <CODE>Click</CODE> event, which occurs when the user clicks the mouse on the control, for
example).

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Labels">Labels</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
None. We saw labels in some detail in the last part of this tutorial. Most
of what we learnt applies equally to all other controls.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Buttons">Buttons</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
None. To make a button do something, add a handler for the <CODE>Click</CODE> event.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Check">Check Boxes</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
To get or set the ``checked'' state, use the <CODE>Checked()</CODE> method.
There are three states - unchecked (0), checked (1) and indeterminate or
grayed (2). Use the
<CODE>Click</CODE> event to respond to changes in state.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Text">Text Fields</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
To get or set the contents of the text field, use the <CODE>-text</CODE> option. The
<CODE>-multiline</CODE> option allows entry of more than one line of text (but beware - the <CODE>-text</CODE> option contains a CRLF sequence (``\r\n'') at the end of each line, not
just LF (``\n'') as is normal for Perl. See the documentation for the
<CODE>-prompt</CODE> option to automatically add a label to a text field.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Progress">Progress Bars</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
A display-only control. Set the parameters with the <CODE>SetRange()</CODE>
and <CODE>SetStep()</CODE> methods, and update the display using the
<CODE>SetPos()</CODE> or <CODE>StepIt()</CODE> methods.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_List">List Boxes</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
By default, there are no items in the list. Fill the list box using the
<CODE>AddString()</CODE> method. Get the selected item using the
<CODE>SelectedItem()</CODE> method. Multiple-selection listboxes are
created using the <CODE>-multisel</CODE> option -- in that case, use the <CODE>SelectedItems()</CODE> method to get
a list of all the selected items.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Combo">Combo Boxes</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Similar to single-selection list boxes (although they display differently).

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_UpDown">UpDown Controls</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This is the little double-arrow control you often see attached to numeric
text fields in dialog boxes. Clicking the up arrow increases the value of
the text field, whereas clicking the down arrow decreases it.

<P>
The only significant complication with using an UpDown control is the need
to associate it with a text box. This is done using the
<CODE>Buddy()</CODE> method, as

<P>
<PRE>    $updown-&gt;Buddy($text)
</PRE>
<P>
Methods exist to set the range of values for the control, and to explicitly
set the value of the control. The control supports a <CODE>Scroll</CODE> event, which is fired when the control value changes (but not when the
associated text box changes!) The UpDown control's size is ignored, as it
is attached to its buddy when it is created.

</DL>
<P>
This covers the basic controls available in Win32::GUI. In part 3, we will
cover some of the subtleties of dialog boxes and main windows, and then in
part 4, we will be ready to cover some of the more complex user interface
options.
