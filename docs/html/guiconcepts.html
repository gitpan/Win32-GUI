<P>
Packages in Win32::GUI can be divided into three main categories: <STRONG>Windows</STRONG>, <STRONG>Controls</STRONG> and <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>; but a big part of the core of this module is in the
<A HREF="././Win32_GUI.html#">Win32::GUI</A> package. All the generic functions are defined there, and all the
components of the user interface inherit from it, so that most of the
functions that refer to windows (eg. Show, Hide, Height, Enable, and so on)
apply to every object and can be used as their methods:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;Show();
    $Window-&gt;Button1-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
Some other functions (like for example GetCursorPos) aren't applicable to
an object, and they require a fully qualified call including the package
name:

<P>
<PRE>    ($x, $y) = Win32::GUI::GetCursorPos();
</PRE>
<P>
<A HREF="#Windows">Windows</A> are the well known windows that you see on your screen; your script will
probably generate one or more window that contain your user interface; this
content is usually made up of <A HREF="#Controls">Controls</A> (eg. labels, buttons, input fields and so on). They can also be considered
as child windows, and, as said, they are all inherited from the Win32::GUI
package.

<P>
<A HREF="#Resources">Resources</A> are of a different category: they build up, so to say, the graphical
Windows toolkit (usually referred to as GDI, Graphics Device Interface);
you'll find there fonts, brushes, bitmaps, icons, cursors and so on. These
objects are generally associated with your windows and controls (eg. you
can set a windows or controls font); some of them, like pens and brushes,
are used instead with the <A HREF="././DC.html#">Win32::GUI::DC</A> package, which implement the drawing primitives.

<P>
There are then some packages that simply don't fit into the three
categories above, because their use goes beyond the simple user interface:
this is the case with <A HREF="././Class.html#">Win32::GUI::Class</A>
and the mentioned <A HREF="././DC.html#">Win32::GUI::DC</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Objects">Objects</A></H3>
<P>
You create an object using its <STRONG>constructor</STRONG>, which is usally of the form:

<P>
<PRE>    $Object = new Win32::GUI::&lt;something&gt;( &lt;options&gt; );
</PRE>
<P>
where &lt;something&gt; is the class of the object you want to create (eg.
Window, Menu, Font, etc.) and &lt;options&gt; are the characteristics of
your object. Once you have the <CODE>$Object</CODE> variable, you can
invoke methods on it:

<P>
<PRE>    $Object-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
A different approach is possible with <STRONG>Controls</STRONG>. Usually, once you created your <CODE>$Window</CODE> object, you will add
controls in it with this construct:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;AddButton( &lt;options&gt; );
</PRE>
<P>
This function will return a <CODE>$Button</CODE> object as you may expect,
but you don't need to store it in a variable: Win32::GUI will use the very
special
<CODE>-name</CODE> option to store the object reference in the window as a named key (or
sub-object):

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;AddButton( -name =&gt; &quot;Button1&quot; );
    $Window-&gt;Button1-&gt;Show();
    # or
    $Window-&gt;{'Button1'}-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
These sub-objects are really hash keys, but for your convenience are also
AUTOLOAD'ed as if they were subroutines (see AutoLoader.pm for details);
this can introduce some confusion if you name an object with the same name
as a Win32::GUI function.

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;AddButton( -name =&gt; &quot;Show&quot; );
    $Window-&gt;Show-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
This syntax will not work because ``Show'' is already defined as a method
of your <CODE>$Window</CODE> object. The advice is to use a different name
for your object, but if you <STRONG>really</STRONG>
can't renounce to it, you can still use the safer syntax:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;{'Show'}-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
It is of course always possible, if you don't mind using too much
variables, to use the less elegant form:

<P>
<PRE>    $Button1 = $Window-&gt;AddButton( ... );
    $Button1-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Options">Options</A></H3>
<P>
The definition of an object is made up of
<STRONG>options</STRONG>, which are pretty much like an associative array; option names are always
lowercase and preceded by a dash (-), while their value vary (can be
strings, numbers, objects or array references).

<P>
A number of options is common to any window (and control), and they're
documented in 
<A HREF="././guioptions.html#">Common options</A>; furthermore, different objects have different specific options,
documented in the single packages reference.

<P>
The most important option for a window is
<CODE>-name</CODE>; this defines the name of the object in its container (as explained above)
and the name used in the <A HREF="#Events">Events</A> naming convention:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;AddButton( -name =&gt; &quot;Button1&quot; );
    
    $Window-&gt;Button1-&gt;Show();
    
    sub Button1_Click { print &quot;ouch!\n&quot;; }
</PRE>
<P>
An example of using a complete set of options:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window = new Win32::GUI::Window(
        -name   =&gt; &quot;Window&quot;,
        -title  =&gt; &quot;Perl Window Example&quot;,
        -left   =&gt; 100,  
        -top    =&gt; 100,
        -width  =&gt; 500, 
        -height =&gt; 400,         
        -menu   =&gt; $Menu,
    );
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="The_dialog_phase">The dialog phase</A></H3>
<P>
After creating your windows and done all the needed initialization
processes, you may probably want your script to present the user with a
window and await for his actions; in other words, you want to interact with
the user. This is done in the dialog phase.

<P>
To enter the dialog phase simply call this instruction:

<P>
<PRE>    Win32::GUI::Dialog();
</PRE>
<P>
or better yet, if you want to check the exit code of your GUI program:

<P>
<PRE>    $exitcode = Win32::GUI::Dialog();
</PRE>
<P>
When the script encounter this instruction, its execution halts and the
user has the ability to interact with what's on the screen. Since windows
are by default created in an invisible state, you may probably call before
something like:

<P>
<PRE>    $Window-&gt;Show();
</PRE>
<P>
if your program is supposed to start with <CODE>$Window</CODE> as its entry
point.

<P>
While in the dialog phase, user's actions will generate <STRONG>Events</STRONG> as needed. This phase ends when an event returns -1 or you press Cancel in
response to a program error (see below for more details); when it ends, the
control returns to the main body of your script (at the line after the one
with the Win32::GUI::Dialog call) and it can go on normally.

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Events">Events</A></H3>
<P>
Events are Perl subs that are called in response to an event occurred in
the user interface, usually generated by an action of the user. For
example, a button has a Click event that is called when the user pushes it.
The naming convention for events follows the Microsoft Visual Basic's one;
its form is:

<P>
<PRE>    OBJECTNAME_Eventname
</PRE>
<P>
(note there's an underscore in between), where <STRONG>OBJECTNAME</STRONG> is the value of the <CODE>-name</CODE>
option used when creating the object, and 
<STRONG>Eventname</STRONG> is the event name, eg. Click. So if you have a button named <CODE>Button1</CODE>, your Click event will be defined as follows:

<P>
<PRE>    sub Button1_Click {
        # ...do something...
    }
</PRE>
<P>
The code inside will be executed when <CODE>Button1</CODE>
gets pressed.

<P>
Win32::GUI also interprets the value returned by the sub; unless otherwise
documented in the event description, the meaning of the return value is:

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_1">1 (one, or a true value)</A></STRONG>
<P>
the script proceeds normally and the event is passed to the underlying
default event processor.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_0">0 (zero)</A></STRONG>
<P>
the dialog phase continues but the event is not passed to the default event
processor (what this means effectively depends on the event).

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item__1_minus_one_">-1 (minus one)</A></STRONG>
<P>
the dialog phase ends, and control returns to the main body of your script.
You will much probably use this to end your program:

<P>
<PRE>    sub Window_Terminate {
        return -1;
    }
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
The behaviour of the default event processor depends on the control and the
event; in case of doubt, is always a good idea to end your event with an
explicit:

<P>
<PRE>    return 1;
</PRE>
<P>
Finally, you should note that events are really
<STRONG>evaluated</STRONG> (as if they were called with <CODE>eval()</CODE>), so that errors are trapped, and a message box is shown. This box reports
the offending event name on the title bar, the error message in its body
and has OK and Cancel buttons. If you press OK, Win32::GUI will ignore the
error and go on with the dialog (the event, of course, doesn't take place);
if you press Cancel instead the dialog will end (with return code -1). This
means that for example if you define an event like:

<P>
<PRE>    sub Button1_Click {
        die();
    }
</PRE>
<P>
your script will not die immediately at the click of a button, but the
message box will appear, reporting for example ``Died at script.pl line
73''.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Windows">Windows</A></H3>
<P>
In its widest acception, windows include what you normally call a window
(sometimes referred to as a ``top level window''), controls (sometimes
referred to as ``child windows'') and even 
<A HREF="#Non_owned_windows">Non-owned windows</A> (not created by Win32::GUI).

<P>
Real (top level) windows are the container of your user interface;
Win32::GUI defines two packages, <A HREF="././Window.html#">Window</A>
and <A HREF="././DialogBox.html#">DialogBox</A>. By default, a Window has a title bar, the usual minimize/maximize/close
buttons, a system menu (the button on the top left corner) and resizable
borders. A DialogBox is very similar, except that by default it cannot be
resized and it doesn't have the minimize and maximize buttons. The main
difference between the two packages is in the dialog phase; DialogBox
intercepts the tab and arrow keys to switch between controls, the use of
Return and Esc for the Ok and Cancel button and accelerators, while Window
not.

<P>
Every window, even windows not created by your Perl script, can be
referenced by Win32::GUI; all you need to know is its ``handle'', a
numerical value that identifies that window. Many functions in the
Win32::GUI package return such handles, as for example:

<P>
<PRE>    $First = Win32::GUI::GetForegroundWindow();
</PRE>
<P>
This value can then be passed to any function that requires a window
object; but of course, not being an object, you can't call it as a method:

<P>
<PRE>    Win32::GUI::Hide($First); # correct
    $First-&gt;Hide();           # wrong
</PRE>
<P>
Should you need to know the numerical handle of a window created by
Win32::GUI, it is stored in its <CODE>-handle</CODE> key (this is the value that almost all function really use):

<P>
<PRE>    print &quot;Window handle is $Window-&gt;{-handle} \n&quot;;
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Colors">Colors</A></H3>
<P>
Wherever you need to express a color, there are two possibilities: 

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_first">first:</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Use a numeric value that contains red, green and blue components (that's
the form Windows uses); expressing this form in hexadecimal, components are
reversed with respect to the traditional (RGB) order:

<P>
<PRE>    0xBBGGRR
</PRE>
<P>
Each components range is 0 to 0xFF, or 255; a value of 0, 0, 0 (0x000000)
represents black, while a value of 255, 255, 255 (0xFFFFFF) represents
white. The following are all valid color definitions in hexadecimal and
decimal format (for practical reasons, you would probably prefer the
hexadecimal notation):

<P>
<PRE>    $color = 0xFF0000;  # blue
    $color = 16711680;  # blue
    $color = 255 &lt;&lt; 16; # blue
    $color = 0x00FF00;  # green
    $color = 65280;     # green
    $color = 0x80FFFF;  # pale yellow
    $color = 8454143;   # pale yellow
</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_second">second:</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Use a reference to a list with 3 values that express the red, green and
blue components as above:

<P>
<PRE>    [ R, G, B ]
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this is NOT a plain list (since a color is usually one parameter
in a list of parameters to a function, it wouldn't make much sense); so the
following forms are valid:

<P>
<PRE>    [ 0, 0, 0 ]
    [ 255, 255, 255]
    [ 0x80, 0xFF, 0xFF ]
    \@color
</PRE>
</DL>
