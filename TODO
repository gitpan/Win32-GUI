- Add missing Common Controls: 
    Pager 
    Ip address
    Drag List Boxes
    Property Sheet?
    HOT Key?
    Flat Scroll bar?
- expand support for GDI drawing
- evtl. support for owner drawn controls
- also search for "TODO" in the GUI.xs (and other) file

- Documentation:
  - revise and correct FAQ
  - any TBD sections
  - get SrcParser.pm to return info about TBD items.
  - get SrcParser to compare packages and methods found in files with 
    documentation found in files
  - split README into README, INSTALLATION and BUILDING
  - remove EVENTS section from auto generated package documentation where 
    it is not relevant
  - review and update the tutorial
  - add tutorial for other controls?
  - add tutorial on NEM
  - add tutorial on using Hook() and pack/unpack to cope with events and 
    messages that are not supported.

- Tests
  - re-write all test using Test::More
  - add at least a check for each package that it generates the correct
    object type
  - GuiTest: with seperate module or add our own Win32::GUI::Test?
     - SendKeys, MouseClick, PushButton, WaitWindow

- Add Win32::GUI::WebBrowser, to give us native HTML support

- Look at seeing if there is a way to prevent PAR (and perl2exe?) packing 
  package Win32, when it's only required for old perls

- GUI.h
  Investigate using __MINGW32__ instead of the __MINGW__ define for mingw
  guard-blocks, as I think that is automatically defined by the compiler

- Makefile.PL
  link stage does not depend on GUI.res, so 'touch GUI.rc'results in rebuilding
  the GUI.res but not re-linking.

- warnings: do something with the tests of PL_dowarn to allow at least perl -X
  to turn off Win32::GUI warnings.
